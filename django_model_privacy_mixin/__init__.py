@status: Alpha - works and is in use on a dedicated project. Is not complete, and needs testing for generalities.

Provides one class PrivacyMixIn which adds Privacy support for model fields in a Django model.

    A MixIn that adds database load overrides which populate the "hidden" attribute of
    an object with the names of fields that should be hidden. It is us to the other
    methods in the model to implement this hiding where desired.

        '''
        Given an object and a user (from request.user typically) will return a list of fields in that object
        that should be hidden. Does this by checking for any attributes in that object that are named visibility_*
        where * is the name of another attribute in the same object for which it specifies visibility rules by means
        of a bit flags. The the flags follow a naming convention as follows:
        
        all - all users can see the named field, namely it's a public piece of info. This is in fact the default
              for all fields that do not have a visibility_* partner. Having such a partner attribute with if no 
              bit flags set will hide the field. Setting the all bit requests the default behaviour.
              
        all_* - all users who have an attribute * which is True can see this field.
    
        all_not_* - all users who have an attribute * which is False can see this field.
        
        share_* - all users who share some value in the * attribute. This is intended for memberships, 
                  where * indicates one or more memberships of a user and of the object and if there's
                  an overlap the field will be visible. In an apocryphal case,* might be "group" and users
                  could be in one or more groups and objects could belong to one or more groups and if the
                  user and the object are both members of at least one group the field will be visible.
