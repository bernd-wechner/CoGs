Testing of new Form Code
Specifically:

1) Load add form with default (inherited) individual mode
    This seems to work. Although it would be nice if number of players was inherited too, if not the actual players.

2) Load add form with default (inherited) team mode
    Yet to test - have to save a team mode session first and then test inheritance and page initialisatioon

3) Swapping modes back and forth on a flexi game with saves between
    Seems to be working am now
