'''
Game Record Import models

Provides:

    1. A model for each of Games, Player and Location storing a map from theit (some other apps) ID to ours (GameMap, PlayerMap, LocationMap)
    2. A model to store import contexts (ImportContext) which bind a set of maps
    3. A model that records Imports (and is used for managing them)
        - Session has a FroegnKey back to here that can optionalle record an import that a Session came from.
        - Session being hte object that binds a game, players, location and results to record a play session.
    4. Proximite measure support (LevenshteinDistance) for matching their game names to ours, players to our etc and providing
        ordered proposals on the basis of proximity for map creation.

# MAP models
#
# Each map belongs to a particular session import (which belongs to a import context) and maps one of their objects
# to one of ours. Any time a new import is attempted with the same context then these maps can be consulted as a first
# step in resolving any mappings.
#
# Ours can be identified with a ForeignKey
#
# Theirs could easily be:
#     an int
#     a UUID
#     a string
#   a combination of these ...
#
# Depends on the import source. So we want a flexible way of storing their key.
# and use  CharField of sufficient length.
#
# We can store ints, UUIDs, strigs in that, even tuples of them in JSON format for example.
