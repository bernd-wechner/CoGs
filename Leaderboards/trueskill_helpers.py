TrueSkill Helpers

Considerable analysis of TrueSkill is presented in "Understanding TrueSkill".

Some of the methods developed therein are provided here for use in analyses.

Some naming conventions used herein:

Symbols are generally treu to those used in "Understanding TrueSkill"

1) Greek symbols are spelled out by name
2) Roman symbols just use the appropriate letter
3) More difficult symbols are adhoc or described

Examples:

mu        The greek letter mu, representing the mean of a Normal (Gaussian) PDF (Probability Density Function)
sigma     The standard deviation of such a PDF
sigma2    The variance of such a PDF (being sigma**2 - i.e. the standard deviation squared)
tau       The greek letter tau, representing the TrueSkill Dynamic Factor (modelling rising uncertainty between plays)
beta      The greek letter beta, representing the TrueSkill SkillFactor (modelling the difference between performance and skill)
w         A partial play weighting
phi       The Normal (Gaussian) CDF
epsilon   The greek letter epsilon, representing the TrueSkill Draw Margin
p         (lower case p) The TrueSkill Draw Probability.
P         (upper case p) A general probability (of something)

Terms of use in reading this code:

skill            a mean and variance pair that models a players skill
rating           a single number derived from skill to rank players by
performance      a mean and variance pair that models the performance of player in a game
player           a single person who plays in a game
team             a group of players that cooperate/collude and share in their victory or otehr ranking as a unit
performer        a player or team
ranker           a performer when dealing with ranks (the ordered outcome of a game, predicted or observed)

class TrueSkillHelpers:
    '''
    A number of helpers to accompany the trueskill package. Technically could/should be in the trueskill package.

    They are based on the document "Understanding TrueSkill" (unpublished but should accompany this file really).

    The methods herein starting with P return probabilities (0-1). That is the focus of interest here. The trueskill
    package implements trueskill updates. BUt there are a string of probabilities that are of interest to anyone
    applying trueskill.

    Performance in this context is very different to the Performance object in the Leaderboards Django app that this
    file is part of. It represents the random variable that describes the performance of a player (or team) based on
    their skill and other variables.

    The other variables are in fact only two in trueskill, being:

    Tau, the Dynamics Factor, which describes essentially skill uncertainty that arises from absense from the game
    (this is very poorly modelled for tabletop games alas in trueskill as it's a constant between game factor and
    not dependent upon time in any way. There is a call to fix that here:

        https://github.com/bernd-wechner/CoGs/issues/13

    Beta, the Skill Factor, which describes essentially the role skill plays in the game (vs luck) and determines
    how far a skill's Mu will move in response to ne evidence (game results). Either way Beta figures prominently
    in probability calculations, generally adding to the uncertainty in skill. Seen another way, it is also a measure
    of how much we expecte performance to vary given a particular skill. And one argument is that it's luck that adds
    to variance. But it can equally well be describing the lundertainty due to any skill detracting features (luck,
    distracting background noise, interruptions, lack of sleep, hunger, lighting, whatever). it is hte prime
    contributor to performance variation over for a given skill rating. It can be tuned for a given game (the luck
    element differentiating games), but how is not queite clear. The issue is discussed here:

        https://github.com/bernd-wechner/CoGs/issues/21

    The key goals here for the Leaderboards app are:

    1) Predict a ranking given a set of player skills
    2) Describe the confidence we have in a given predicted ranking
    3) Describe the match quality (TODO) this is a measure of how enjoyable this match should have been
        (aka how

        tuple.

        We need to build a list ranked performance lists (mu, sigma2, w triplets) to pass
        to the internal helpers.

        These are derived from Django ORM Rank objects, imported in the header.

        For conformance with Predicted_ranking, a tuple of rankers (player or Team objects)
        is returned by default. But there is possible scoring information attached to the
        Rank objects which provide these rankers, and if a caller wishes to dislay rankers
        and scores they may wish to receive Rank objects which provides both.

        Predicted_ranking does not need this option as the prediction is based soley upon
        player ratings and scores are not predicted, only a ranking is.

                      The comparison is interesting because the very aim of TrueSkill's skill adjustments is that the
                      probability of this ranking is higher with the updated skills. In short we should see TrueSkill
                      doing it's work if P_ranking(after) is higher than P_ranking(after) for a given set of ranks,
