			Individual play affects two models (and involves two types of object) which need IDs in hidden fields for
			edit forms to work, which can be absent or take any value for add forms.
				Rank: Each player has a rank with an ID in the Rank model (for this session)
				Performance: Each player has an ID in the Performance model (for this session)

			We define here simple templates, that are used by the accompanying Javascript (form_rankings.js) to create
			a table of players based on templatePlayersTable with one row per player based on templatePlayersBody.

			We only need Rank scores for individual play. Performance scores are not used. And the score field is
			dynamically shown or hidden based on the game.scoring.

			Team play affects three models (and involves three types of object) which may need IDs in
			hidden fields for edit forms to work, which can be absent for add forms.
				Team: Each team has an ID in the Team model, but we won't use it here as Teams are
				      defined in the first instance by the players on them which we'll infer from
				      the players submitted.
				Rank: Each team has a rank with an ID in the Rank model (for this session)
				Performance: Each player has an ID in the Performance model (for this session)

			A Team play form has scroing fields for rank and performance. They are respecviely hidden or
			shown based on the selected games scoring system which can be configured to include TEAM and/or
			INDIVIDUAL scoring.
