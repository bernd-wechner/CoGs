		Sessions are very particular and perhaps the most complicated object we use and hence teh cmost complicated form we have to drive it

		We include the standard form above but the Session object is pointed to by:
			Rank objects - one for each player or team (depending on play mode) points to this session object
				Rank objects either record a player or a team
				If a team, then:
					Team objects - one for each team (records the players in this team and an optional name)
			Performance objects - one for each player, points to this session object (captures the partial play weighting for that player in this session, and ultimately stores the trueskill impacts of this session for that player)

		We need form elements to enter all this and to properly initialise and respond to the various object IDs in this complex interrelationship.
