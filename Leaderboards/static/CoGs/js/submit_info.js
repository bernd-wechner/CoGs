// Basic Javascript to include in any page for it to submit to Django some client info. Specifically
// 3 items are sent to Django:
//
// timezone     - The TZ database timezone name
// utcoffset    - Positive being East of Greenwich
// location     - in form "City, Country"
//
// They are submitted to a URL provided in the variable POST_RECEIVER,
// which must be defined in urls.py of course and be backed by a small 
// view which receives and does something with the submission.
//
// The timezone data and location data are posted separately, as the first 
// is fast and reliable, the second slower and less reliable (may not be available).
//
// We expect CSRF_field and POST_RECEIVER to be set in the including template!
// as we need both the URL to post to (POST_RECEIVER) and the CSRF (Cross-Site
// Request Forgery prvention) token that Django supplies and insists on hearing
// back in a PSOT request or it will not accept it (CSRF_feld).
//
// Also the 3 items are only submitted if they are changed from references that are
// supplied in:
//
// SESSION_timezone
// SESSION_utcoffset
// SESSION_location
//
// If these three values are stored in the Djnago Session, they have the lifespan of Django
// Session which is essentially  from the first page load indefinitely into the future (until
// such time as the session_id cookie is lost - that is, the session is attached ot one browser 
// on one machine by a session_id cookie, and it has lifespan as long as that cookie - which is 
// until it's removed. 
//
// If a change is detected - typically only on the very first surf into the sute given the 
// lifespan of Django sessions - then the page is reloaded so that it renders with timezone
// awareness. It the rendering view is smart enough to tell us it is timezone insensitive by
// providing a variable TIMEZONE_insensitive, we won't reload the page.

// GET_ variables used for getting the location of the client
// We will use the GeoNames free service: http://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html#findNearby

// Django provides (and demands if the server implemts it) Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection 
// Django proveds us with a csrf_token which it wants to see in a POST submission or it will reject it.
// This how Django knows the POST came from this form here and not some other submitter. 
// The token comes as a HTML hidden form element, and we're building out own POST submission so
// need to extract the name and value and compose a URI (Uniform Resource Identifer).
