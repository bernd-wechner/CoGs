        Implicit events are those inferred from Session records, and not explicitly recorded as events.

        They are defined as all block of contiguous sessions that have gap_days (defaulting 1) between
        them. The remaining arguments are filters

        :param cls:
        :param leagues:      A list of League PKs to restrict the events to (a Session filter)
        :param locations:    A list of location PKs to restrict the events to (a Session filter)
        :param dt_from:      The start of a datetime window (a Session filter)
        :param dt_to:        The end of a datetime window (a Session filter)
        :param duration_min: The minimum duration (in days) of events (an Event filter)
        :param duration_max: The maximum duration (in days) of events (an Event filter)
        :param gap_days:     The gap between sessions that marks a gap between implicit Events.
        :param week_days     A CSV string list of week day numbers (0-6)
        :param month_weeks   A CSV string list of month wek numbers (1-5)
        :param minimum_event_duration: Sessions are recorded with a single time (nominally completion).
                                       Single session events will have a duration of 0 as a consequence.
                                       This, in hours expresses the average game duration of a single game
                                       session.  It's nominal and should ideally be the duration it takes

                                       case from the expected play time of the game. But to use that will
