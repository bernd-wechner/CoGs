class ChangeLog(AdminModel):
    '''
    A model for storing a log of edits to recorded sessions. Any such edit has an immediate impact,
    on a leaderboard (i.e a leaderboard before it happened and a learboard after it happened. These
    are stored here in this model). A log can be written any time a session is added or edited, and the
    Admin fields on the entry record who did that, while the object stores leaderboard snaphots
    before and after (the session, not the edit).

    Such logs can be expired as well (as storing a full before and after leaderboard for ever session
    add or edit adds a lot of data, and has diminishing value when the entries are considered stable.
    This model is mainly for report impacts before a commit linking to a rebuild log if a rating rebuild
    was triggered.

    A session is defined by:
        a game
        a time
        a league
        a location (venue)
        a mode (team or individual depending on what the game supports)
        a list of ranks (one per ranker, being a team or player depending on mode)
        a list of performances (one per performer, being a player).

    A given session has two leaderboard of interest, the state of the game's leaderboard before that
    session was played and after. This is what provides a measure of the impact that session has on a
    leaderboard (the state of the leaderboard before the session is of course its state immediately
    after the previous session of that game. This is porovided by session.leaderboard_impact().

    Given we want to record the impact of that session before and after this logged change we have 2
    such impacts to store (4 leaderboard snapshots). There could be some duplication of data there,
    specifically if the session game and date_time are not rebuild triggering (changed game or date_time
    changed to alter sequence of sessions) then the two before snapshot sin these impacts will be
    identical. In the rather odd case of a logged change that has no impact on the after boards they
    will  be identical too (though hard to imagine a change worth logging that has no impact!).

    TODO: This is a place to store impacts for reporting and presentation for review before
    confirming a commit. That will rely on a transaction manager (in the making) which can hold
    a database transaction open across a few views.

    The idea is that we can store impacts in this model with a key so that they can be calculated,
    saved, and the key passed to a confirmation view where the change can be committed or rolled back.

    A log of rating rebuilds.

    Kept for two reasons:

    1) Performance measure. Rebuild can be slow and we'd like to know how slow.
    2) Security. To see who rebuilt what when

    Unlike change logs these should be persisted

    When we make any changes to any recorded game Session that is NOT the latest game session (for
    that game and all the players playing in that game session) then it has an impact on the
    leaderboards for that game that is distinct from it's own immediate impact. To clarify:

    When any session is changed it has an immediate impact which is how it alters the leaderboard
    from the immediately prior played session of that game.

    If there are future sessions relative to the session just changed then it also has an impact on
    the current leaderboard. The immediate impact above is not the current leaderboard (because
    other session of that game are in its future) and so the impact on the current leaderboard is
    also useful to see.

    This is true whether a session is added, or altered (in any one of many ratings impacting
    ways: players change, ranks change, game changes etc)or deleted.

    We'd like to show these impacts for any edit before they are committed.

    The current leaderboard impacts are tricky as the current leaderboards could be changing
    while we're reviewing our commit for example (other user submitting results).
