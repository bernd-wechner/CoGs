        Internal support for the future_session property, this is a recursive method
        that takes a list of sessions found so far so as to avoid duplicating any
        sessions in the search.

        Why recursion? Because future sessions is an influence tree where each
        node branches a multiple of times. Consider agame that involves four
        playes P1, P2, P3, P4. We can get all future session in this game that
        any of these four players played in with a simple query. BUT in all
        those sessions they maybe (probably) played with otehr people. So say
        theres a futre session between P1, P2, P5 and P6? Well we need to find
        all the future sessions in this game that involve P1, P2, P5 or P6! So
        essentially future sessions fromt he simpe query can drag in new players
        which form new influence trees.

        The premise in building this tree is that it is is far more efficient than
        reacuaulating Trueskill ratings on them all. Thus finding a count helps us
        estimate the cost of performing a rebuild.

        all players at the time this session was played, while the latest game board
        uses the ratings as they stand. A difference suggests the ratings don't reflect
        the performances and a data integrity issue.

        dict that captures a summary of changes.

        If no form_data is supplied just returns dict_from_object.

        A note on IDs:
            dict_from_object always contains a session ID and database
                objects have an ID.
            dict_from_form is not guranteed to have one, in fact it's
                doesn't by default (one can be supplied), because when
                editing database objects the ID is not an editable field,
                and the model form does not include it, instead it is
                communicated vie the URL match generally not through the
                posted form data.
            As such a diff, ignores an ID change if the form data is
            missing an ID it is ignored for delta change sumaries.

        Warning:
            pk MUST be provided if a delta between an edit form and the object
            (before edit is applied) is wanted.

            If pk is not provided and form_data is supplied we assume, the
            form data to be from an Add/Create form not from an Update/Edit
            form.

            If a caller wishes to compare an edit proposal and fails to supply
            a PK, thechange summary may erroneoulsy report "crreated" when
            "changed" is more appropriate to the context. Supplying a PK is
            the way in which a claler mmakrs the form_data as a Update not an
