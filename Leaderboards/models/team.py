        '''
        Get, create or edit a team with the specified players.

        Teams are fundamentally identified by the players in them. To wit, the Team ID is a not
        especially relevant. It can happen the a Session is edited, and the team members changed
        though. And so we have a scheme for recyling Team IDs as needed.

        Teams have a name but this is incidental totheir defintion and not used in defining a
        team, itis just a presentation convenience.

        Essentially there are a few scenarios for calling:

        The basic get or create (no "name" or "edit" provided):
            looks for an existing team witht hose players and returns it if found.
            else creates one.
            If more than one is found, raises and exception. This should never happen.

        The get and rename, or create (a "name" is supplied but no "edit")
            Same as the basic get or create but if a team is found renames it,
            and if a team is created names witht he provided name.

        The edit (an "edit" is provided and maybe a "name")
            the "edit" identifies a team and optionally a rank and/or session
            being edited as team edits most likely occur as part of a
            session edit. So "edit" is a 3-tuple of (team ID, rank ID, session ID)
            where any of these can be None with a fallback behaviour that is robust.

            Ideally we have all three on a session edit as it would submit the
            session, rank and possibly the team IDs as part of the edit.

            Crucially "players" may have changed in the edit (been added, removed,
            completely changed etc.).

            So we first see if there's an existing team with those players. If so
            we can reuse that, and optionally rename it (if a name was provided).
            Then the "edit" team ID is checked to see if it has any other references,
            If not we can delete that team from the system. If a rank ID and/or session
            ID was provided we tolerate one reference to that rank and session, otherwise
            we tolerate only 0 references.

            If the another team found with those players we need to update the session's
            rank to point to the new team! We require during an edit that any nominated
            rank belongs to any nominate session. If it differs from the rank of the team
            we presume the team was assigned to a new rank as part of the edit.

            If players don't change, we might optionally just rename this team if a
            name was provided.

        :param players: An iterable of Player objects
        :param name: optionally a name for the team, will set it if provided.
        :param edit: A tuple of Team ID a Rank Id and a Session ID to flag that this call
                    is part of a session edit (and or all might be None - with a fallback
                    behaviour).
        :param debug: If true does a duplicity check on entry and exit and breaks in the debugger
                      if duplicty found, to faciliate debugging and testing.
