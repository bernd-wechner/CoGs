def view_Impact(request, model, pk):
    '''
    A view to show the impact of submitting a session.

    Use cases:
        Submission feedback for:
            A session has been added and no rating rebuild was triggered
            A session was added and a rating rebuild was triggered (i.e. it was not the latest session for for that game and all players in it)
            A session was edited and no rating rebuild was triggered
            A session was edited and a rating rebiild was triggered
        A later check on the impact of that session, it may be that:
            The session has one or more change logs (it has been added, and edited, one or more times - such loghs are not guranteed to hang around for ever)
            The session triggered a rebuild one or more times.

            The context of the view can be either:
                based on ther last change log found if any, or
                neutral (not change log found for reference)

    :param request:    A Django request object
    :param model:      The name of a model (only 'session' supported at present)
