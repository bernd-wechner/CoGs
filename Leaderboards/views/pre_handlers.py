def reconcile_ranks(form, session_dict, permit_missing_scores=False):
    '''
    We MUST have ranks to create session. Scores are optional.
    Furthermore Rank scores are needed for determing ranks (if not explicitly provided),
    while Performance scores are used only to calculate rank scores if they are missing.
    Performance scores exist primarily to support the edge case of a game played in teams
    (so one rank per team) which concludes with individual player scores (on performance
    per player).

    The reconciliation is as follows:

    1. If the game.scoring is not None, then require scores and bounce.
         a. There should be an option to override this bounce if valid rankings are provided,
            for two reasons:
              i. While the game is scored, someone may have recorded results without
                 noting them, anbut has rankings and this is all that's needed for
                 updating ratings and leaderboards so it should be accceptable and
                 accepted.
             ii. All legacy sessions (prior to to the introduction of scoring in the
                 site) lack recorded scores. It should be possible if needed to edit
                 such a seshandlersion and submit. An edge case, but a consistency issue as
                 well.
    2. If rank scores are provided:
         a. using the game.scoring method (high wins or low wins) establish
            a ranking.
         b. if ranks were provided, reconcile them with this result, and bail
            with a warning if they don't agree. Ranks should be provided for
            tie breakers. That is, many games which conclude with a score,
            have nuanced tie breaking rules and the onlyw ay to sensibly capture
            those generically across any and all games is by submitting a ranking
            (along with the scores).
    3. If any rank scores were not provided but performance scores were:
         a. Calculate a ranks core as the sum of the related performance scores
            Ranks can map 1 to 1 to performances in most games, but in games played
            in teams they map 1 to n, n being th enumber of team members.

    Use self.form.add_error(None, f"message") to bounce if needed.

        # 2) team play mode submission: See similar results exemplified by:
