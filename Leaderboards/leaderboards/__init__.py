def augment_with_deltas(master, baseline=None, structure=LB_STRUCTURE.game_wrapped_session_wrapped_player_list, style=None):
    '''
    Given a master leaderboard and a baseline to compare it against, will
    augment the master with delta measures (adding a previous rank
    and rating elements to each player tuple)

    This is very flexible with structures and formats. Accepts JSON and Python and
    each of the leaderboard structures and returns the same. General purpose augmenter
    of playlists with a previous rank item based on the baseline.

    By default, only master is needed. if it is a game_wrapped_session_wrapped_player_list
    with snapshots in it no baseline is needed and all the snapshots will be delta augmented.

    Only two styles are supported, rich and data. They are the only two that currently include
    a unique player ID which cna be used for tha ugmentation.

    :param master:      a leaderboard
    :param baseline:    a leaderboard to compare with. None is valid only for a game_wrapped_session_wrapped_player_list with snaps
    :param structure:   an LB_STRUCTURE that master and baseline are to interpreted with
    :param style:       an LB_PLAYER_LIST_STYLE, which will be guessed at if need be, so we know where to get the rank and rating from to augment with.
