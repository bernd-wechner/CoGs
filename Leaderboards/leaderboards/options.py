class leaderboard_options:
    '''
    Captures the options that can be made available to and be submitted by a web page when
    requesting leaderboards.

    Three key parts in the class:

    1) Some enum defintions for selectable options. Defined as lists of 2-tuples.
        The lists and the enums built fromt hem are useful in code and the
        context of a Leaderboards page (the lists of 2 tuples for example can
        be used to construct select widgets).

        These are CamelCased

    2) The options themselves. They ar elower case words _ seaprated.

    3) Methods:

        A constructor that can receives a QueryDcit from requst.GET or reuqest.POST
        and build an instance on basis of what is submitted. A default instance if
        none is supplied.

        A JSONifier to supply context with a dict of JSONified options so the options
        can conveniently be used in a template.

        As a QuerySet this should ideally remain unevaluated on return (remain lazy).
            In practice if include_baseline is True, it may need evaluation.

        A flag that is set to true if we've been asked to include a baseline and a
        baseline outside of the requested window of snapshots was found and added.
        if this is true the client is effictively asked to hide that baseline (the
        last/earliest) session in the returned QuerySet. if false either no baseline
        is included or it is but it falls withing the winodow of snapshots requested.


        A snapshot is the leaderboard as it appears after a given game session
        The default and only standard snapshot is the current leaderboard after the
        last session of the game.

        But this can be altered by:

        A perspective request:
           lo.as_at which asks for the leaderboard as at a given time (not the latest one)

        Evolution requests:
           lo.evolution_options documents the possible selections

        We build a QuerySet of the sessions after which we want the leaderboard snapshots.

        :param game:        A Game object for which the leaderboards are requested
        :param include_reference: If True, will include a reference snapshot (that defines the leaderboard before the first snapshot in the queryset)
        :param include_baseline: If True will include a baseline snapshot (the one just prior to those requested) so that deltas can be calculated by the caller if desired)

        Make the relative leaderboard_options more static. Specifically the event based ones.

        It's hard to secure a perfectly static leaderboards link becasue anything could change
        in the database over time, players come and go, games come and go whatever, there are
        just too many variables and the closest we could get really is to store the cache that
        is currently stored in the session in a more persistent database table with an ID.

        But can't see much need for that yet. Right now the main aim is that we can rapidly
        get the impact of the last event (prior to as_at) but produce a link that uses
        fixed reference times rather than the relative so they can be used in comms and
        have lasting relevance.

        :param ufilter: a user filter, i.e request.session.filter dictionary that specifies
                        the session default. Currently only 'league' is used to populate the
                        options with a default league filter based on session preferences.
                        Is extensible.
