Here's what I'm in middle of:

Just fixed it so get_related_forms handles data sources properly priority is form submitted data, then database data, then empty.
So it now works when a clean raises a ValidationError, and bounces back to the View, with form data.

Now I need to find a place to put a relationship clean for a whole session. Model.clean() is only for internal model related stuff.
I need an overarching entry point to define a related_clean or compound_clean, namely a clean that cleans a whole Session with its ranks and performances.
