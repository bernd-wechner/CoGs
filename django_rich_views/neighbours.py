Django Rich Views

Neighbour Identification

Specifically for browsing objects in DetailViews. This should really be spun out as a separate
package or arguably absorbed in some form or other into Django core.

Possible extension might be to allow n-hops away neighbours, so neighbours either side, 2, 5, 10
jumps away. For nuanced browsing.

    Given a model and pk that identify an object (model instance) will, given an ordering

    #    https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/17741
    #
    # But this, it seems is the reliable method which involves dipping into Django's
    # innards a litte (the SQL compiler)
