def wrap_filter(queryset, sql_where_crtiteria):

    A sad shortfall in Django at present is that we cannot filter on Window functions used as
    annotations.

    See:
        https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30104
        https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/28333
            "the window function expression should be wrapped in an inner query,
            and the filtering should be done in an outer query."

    Here  is our workaround until that is fixed in Django, namely we wrap a select/where
    around the exisitng queryset explicitly.

    Alas in so doing we turn it into a raw queryset.

    First we need the SQL from the existing query. Many on-line sources seem to recommend
    str(qs.query) but this does not return reliable SQL! A bug in Django which is much
    discussed:
       https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30132
       https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25705
       https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25092
       https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24991
       https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/17741

    So we need to dig deeper in to Django and fetch it from the query compiler.

    TODO: neighbours.py should use this too.
    '''

    # str(queryset.query) is woefully inadequate here, but we can get reliable
    # SQL from the query compiler as follows.
    sql, params = queryset.query.get_compiler(using=queryset.db).as_sql()

    # Now we can wrap that SQL in a new SELECT/WHERE statement to secure our filter
    sql = "SELECT * FROM ({}) ao WHERE {}".format(sql, sql_where_crtiteria)

    # And we can return the raw queryset we've built
    return queryset.model.objects.raw(sql, params)


def top(queryset, number_of_rows, use_slice=True):
    '''
    A small queryset wrapper to get the top rows of a queryset, optionally without slicing it.

    Slicing causes evaluation.

    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/models/querysets/#when-querysets-are-evaluated

    Though to be honest it mostly doesn't and slicing with [:number_of_rows] may well,
    if it's the last operation, also returns an unevaluated QuerySet.

        #     params is a list or dictionary of parameters.
    This method:

    a) is postgresql specific, no guarantee it will work on another database engine
    b) produces a raw queryset adding a LIMIT specifier.

    As per the example here:

        https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/models/expressions/#subquery-expressions

    It seems that slicing if done prudently does the same but must be the last
    operation on a queryset. This may of course also be true of a raw queryset,

    TODO: Can a raw querset be filtered further and what is the SQL produced? If
    the answer is yes, and subsequent filters apply to a wrapped queryset in the
    manner of wrap_filter() above or as asked for here:

        https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/28333

    then this manner of taking the top slice is better (because it need not
    then, be the last operation on a queryset).
