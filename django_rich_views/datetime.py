    The colons are encoded as : - Works on Chrome even though it's
    a reserved character not encouraged for URL use.

    The space between date and time is encoded as + and so arrives
    as a space.

    A - introducing the timezone passes through unencoded.

    A + introducing the timezone arrives here as a space

    Just in case : in the URL does cause an issue, up front we'll
    support - which travels undamaged from URL to here, as the
    hh mm ss separator.

    All the while we are using the ISO 8601 format for datetimes,
    or encoded versions of it that we try to decode here.
