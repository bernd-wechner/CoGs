    <h2>What are CoGs?</h2>
    Competitive Gamers. Just a moniker game players who like to compete.
    Specifically at tabletop games, sometimes going under the labels of
    board games, card games, social games, Euro games, German games.
    <h2>What is a leaderboard?</h2>
    A list of all the players, of a given game ranked by some measure of
    performance or skill.
    Every game has its own leaderboard. There are <a
      href="http://www.pga.com/news/golf-leaderboard">Golf leaderboards</a>,
    <a href="https://www.atpworldtour.com/en/stats/leaderboard">Tennis
      leaderboards</a>, <a
      href="https://www.chess.com/leaderboard/live">Chess leaderboards</a>
    and more. The CoGs Leaderbard Space hopes provides a place to store,
    manage and present leaderboards for any number of games (Golf
    excluded ;-).
    <h2>What's the Leaderboard Space?</h2>
    A place to track leaderboards for tabletop games. The Leaderboard
    Space is where many leaderboards for tabletop games live (and are
    managed and presented). It's is at its heart, a database with a web
    interface, as are most web sites today.
    <h2>Why leaderboards?</h2>
    Leaderboards are popular for a number of reasons:
    <ol>
      <li> They offer a meta-game or meta-competition, that surrounds a
        given game.<br>
        You're not just competing with your opponents at a given game
        session, but with all players over time, for long term rankings.
      </li>
      <li> They help plan balanced games.<br>
        Players at similar ranks can plan to play together, helping to
        avoid runaway victories and create more in-game tension.
      </li>
      <li> They promote replay and focus.<br>
        Get better at a game you like, play it again and again. Of
        particular relevance in the tabletop gaming world where new
        games are being published at unprecendent rates, and the novelty
        factor and game learning are eclipsing enjoyment of good quality
        games. </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How are players ranked on a leaderboard?</h2>
    We use the <a
href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/trueskill-ranking-system/">TrueSkill</a>
    algorithm to estimate a players skill (or rating), measured in teeth
    (CoGs have teeth after all) at a game based on the
    history of their plays (of that game).
    We derive a rating using the recorded performance (history of game
    placements), and rank players on a given leaderboard (for a given
    game) based on that rating.
    Leaderboards can be for a specific league or global.
    <h2>What is a league?</h2>
    A gaming league is just a group of players who are interested in
    running a leaderboard against one another. It's a useful way of
    group players who habitually play together. The CoGs Leaderboard
    space can present leaderboards
    that include only the players of a specified league, or globally.
    Every player has a primary league noted, and if they have an account
    and log in, thenvarious views will default to the primary league.
    Otherwise various views can be filtered to show players, teams,
    games or sessions of on league only.
    <h2>What is stored in the CoGs Leaderboard space?</h2>
    We aim to store everything needed to calculate TrueSkill ratings as
    nothing more. That is, primarily:
    <ul>
      <li> Basic player information.<br>
        Includes an email for sending notifications if desired, and <a
          href="http://boardgamegeek.com">BoardGameGeek</a> ID if
        desired, where more player information can be offered/found.
      </li>
      <li> Basic game information.<br>
        Only details that help manage leaderboards. A <a
          href="http://boardgamegeek.com">BoardGameGeek</a> ID is stored
        for each game where possible to provide links to further
        information.
      </li>
      <li> Session records.<br>
        Every game session is time stamped, identifies the game played,
        the league that it played in, a venue, the order the players
        finished in and the portion of the game they played
      </li>
      <li> Supporting information for those session records:<br>
        Basically summary info about leagues, venues and teams (groups
        of players playing together)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How is a TrueSkill rating calculated?</h2>
    There's plenty to read about TrueSkill <a
href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B11fEatiLQkhMmlWSV9vTjlFNHM">on-line</a>,
    but in summary:
    <ol>
      <li>TrueSkill attempts to assess a players skill at a given game.
      </li>
      <li>It acknowledges that skill is an uncertain thing, that we are
        trying to assess (that is, we are unsure of a given player's
        skill).
      </li>
      <li>Therefore it models skill as a probability distribution (PD)
        rather than a value
        <ul>
          <li>At it's simplest you could view this as a way of saying, a
            player's skill is probably one value, confidently at least
            another value and confidently at most another value.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Everyone is given the same initial skill PD
      </li>
      <li>Evidence, that is, game results, are used to modify the PD
        using <a href="iki/Bayes%27_theorem">Bayes' Theorem</a>.
      </li>
      <li>In general the expected value of skill tries to track
        performance, and the confidence in that value rises with more
        and more evidence.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>And with that in mind, a little more detail, with specific
      attention to how we at the CoGs Leaderboard Space use TrueSkill:</p>
    <p>A rating (in teeth) is assigned to each player for any given
      game, which is a summary of the PD that TrueSkill has calculated
      from the evidence.</p>
    <p>In practice, the PD is modeled by a <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">Gaussian
        or Normal distribution</a>, which can be described by two
      values, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean">mean</a>
      and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance">variance</a>
      (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation">standard
        deviation</a>).</p>
    <p>In layman's terms the Normal Distribution is the probably
      familiar bell curve (hence it's name "Normal", because it's pretty
      often seen) and the mean describes where the peak of the bell is,
      while the variance (or standard deviation) describes the width of
      the bell. A high variance is a wide bell, a low variance a narrow
      bell. <br>
    </p>
    <p>The mean can be considered the most likely skill and the variance
      is a measure of our uncertainty, or confidence. That is, the lower
      the variance (the narrower the bell curve) the more confident we
      are that skill is close to that mean. Conversely the higher thew
      variance (the wider the bell) the more uncertain we are about that
      mean.</p>
    <p>We can't use a a bell curve to rank players though, we need a
      single value to order them by, some assessment of skill. We could
      choose the most likely value (the mean) and run with that. But
      instead we use a value that we are very confident the skill is "at
      least", some value below the mean. The standard deviation is
      useful here. <br>
    </p>
    <p>If we used the mean as the rating we're effectively saying that
      we're 50% sure that the players skill is at least this.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If we were to use the mean minus one standard deviation, we're
      saying that we're about 84% sure that the players skill is at
      least that value. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      If we were to use the mean minus two standard deviations, we're
      saying that we're about 98% sure that the players skill is at
      least that value. <br>
    </p>
    <p>If we were to use the mean minus three standard deviations, we're
      saying that we're about 99.9% sure that the players skill is at
      least that value.
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>TrueSkill by default uses the mean minus three standard
      deviations to estimate skill (though it's configurable), so the
      99.9% confidence level. The skill we're 99.9% sure you at least
      have!<br>
    </p>
    <p>Every time new evidence arrives (a new game result is recorded)
      the TrueSkill PD is recalculated (using Bayes' Theorem) for each
      player who participated, and a new rating determined from the new
      PD. <br>
    </p>
    <h2>How do TrueSkill ratings behave?</h2>
    <p>
      There are some TrueSkill parameters that can be tuned either
      globally or for a given game. On the whole though:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your rating at a given game will start at 0 (precisely because
        the initial PD has a mean that is three standard deviations
        above zero)
      </li>
      <li>As you play games, win or lose, the standard deviation gets
        lower, or the confidence in our assessment of your skill rises.
        This effectively raises your rating (because the mean minus
        three standard deviations goes up) - simply by playing.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>It will rise more quickly at first, and more slowly as more
          and more evidence is collected (i.e. game results are
          recorded).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>After a given game is recorded some players' ratings will go
        up and others may go down. Winners tend to steal ratings from
        losers.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Known issues with TrueSkill</h2>
    <p>
      TrueSkill is not perfect. Nothing is. And there are some known
      issues at present (waiting for you, if you're math whiz with
      passion and time or funding, to fix). Some of these will allow
      players to game the system so to speak.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rating risk: <br>
        Because winners tend to steal ratings from losers, there's a
        definite risk to playing if your rating is high. <br>
        So someone with a very high rating may feel inclined to protect
        their rating by not playing any more.
        <br>
        The current leader so to speak on any leaderboard has only one
        direction to go after all ... down. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Strategic opponent selection: <br>
        If you understand the algorithm well, it's conceivable to choose
        opponents which maximise the liklihood of a ratings improvement.
        <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Biased draws: <br>
        You'd expect in a draw that all drawing players experience the
        same impact to their rating. <br>
        Alas, that is not guaranteed.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>All these issues can be fixed. Let's hope someone does. In the
      mean time we feel TrueSkill is the best rating system available to
      gamers, and a bulk of the Chess fraternity (through the adoption
      of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Elo</a>)
      and the Xbox community (through the application of TrueSkill)
      agree. </p>
    <h2>Who runs this site?</h2>
    The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CoGsLeagueHobart/">Competitive
      Gamers League of Hobart</a> (CoGs Hobart).
    <br>
    <h2>What is the status of the site?
    </h2>
    <p><a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#BETA">Beta</a>.
    </p>
    <p>There's an adage in innovation circles that if you release a
      product when it's ready, you've released too late! </p>
    <p>It's a very busy world out there, and time to market is more
      important than ever!
      Not that this site has a particularly aggressive market or grand
      aspirations. It's a service to one small community of gamers in
      the first instance with readiness to grow if popularity rises and
      others want to join and help grow it. To wit, we're putting this
      out there well before it's ready, or anywhere near as complete as
      we'd like. There's a to-do list longer than
      any current leaderboard (the tip of the iceberg is listed on <a
        href="https://github.com/bernd-wechner/CoGs/issues">github</a>)
      and it's not getting smaller in any hurry.
      But it works, and is being used for the CoGS Hobart League, day to
      day, so it's time it showed a public face, so that league members
      can look up leaderboards and track results. </p>
    <h2>What technology does this site use?</h2>
    Aside from TrueSkill, it's built using the <a
      href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> web framework
    (written in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>) and
    running at present on a <a
      href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/">Raspberry
      Pi 2</a> in someone's basement. So if it's a little or a lot
    sluggish and up-time is not guaranteed, you know why.
    <h2>Can I help improve the site?</h2>
    <p>
      You sure can! Please!<br>
    </p>
    <p>To date it's had one developer only who can give it the likes of
      5 to 10 hours a month of effort. </p>
    <p>Three others have offered to help, none yet actually contributed.
    </p>
    <p>The code base is all on <a
        href="https://github.com/bernd-wechner/CoGs">github</a>.&nbsp;
      Anyone can fork, and contribute. I hope there's enough in the <a
href="https://github.com/bernd-wechner/CoGs/blob/master/README.md">ReadMe</a>
      to help anyone with some comfort with Python to implement locally,
      run, debug, and see open issues.
    </p>
    <p>The project is openly in need of contributors.</p>
    <h2>What is the history of the CoGs Leaderboard Space?</h2>
    <p>In 2004 a small group of tabletop gaming enthusiasts started to
      run the <a
href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/HoGS_Tasmania/conversations/messages/4">Hobart
        Winter Games nights</a> under the banner of <a
        href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/HoGS_Tasmania/info">HoGS</a>,
      the Hobart Games Society. <br>
    </p>
    <p>In 2012 the group was meeting in public halls weekly, was
      flourishing so a focus group and event was tabled: HoGS Hardcore,
      dedicated to competitve strategic gaming. <br>
    </p>
    <p>HoGS Hardcore was an a response to two growing trends at HoGS
      weekly games nights:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>A struggle to bring hard core strategic games to the table for
        head on competition. <br>
        With a steady influx of new gamers and a great diversity of
        gamers, and games a slight bias towards more accessible games
        that suited everyone at a given table emerged.</li>
      <li>A struggle to replay favourite games<br>
        With an incredibly growth in the game publication industry and
        in the gaming community, more and more players were assembling
        larger and larger collections with a never ending need to table
        new games. Novelty was eclipsing experience.&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
    <p>HoGS Hardcore was surprising popular, but not to everyone's taste
      and with some accusations of elitism so HoGS shelved the idea.</p>
    <p>In 2014 then the Hardcore group reformed as the CoGs League, the
      Competitive Gamers League running a complimentary monthly meet
      focused now on competition and the idea of leaderboards.<br>
    </p>
    <p>CoGs started with a simple spreadsheet and scoring system to
      calculate ratings, but couldn't settle on something fair that
      worked across all games irrespective of the number of players.
      Then they found TrueSkill.<br>
    </p>
    <p>2014 was full of experimentation with TrueSkill. Some software
      libraries turned up, notably in Python and C#, and a simple
      TrueSkill server was toyed with in Python<br>
    </p>
    <p>By 2015 CoGs decided to code up a website opting&nbsp; for the
      Python route and the Django web framework.<br>
    </p>
    <p>By late 2016 CoGs was managing leaderboards on its nascent web
      site (running internally).<br>
    </p>
    <p>In late 2017 the website was deployed publicly to permit CoGs
      Players to see leaderboards and play around with views and
      filters.<br>
